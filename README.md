# vue-webpack-template-plus

[Vue's official webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) +
[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) +
[Element](http://element.eleme.io/) +
[Pug](https://pugjs.org/) +
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) +
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) +
[Semantic UI SCSS](https://github.com/aniftyco/semantic-ui-sass) +
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

This gives you 4 additional
[vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) options:


> A full-featured Webpack setup with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction.

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible. For Vue 1.x you can try this command: `vue init JanCVanB/vue-webpack-template-plus#1.0 my-project` (However, I'm not testing this fork with Vue 1.x, so use at your own risk.)

## Why use Vuex, Element, Pug, Sass, and/or Yarn?

These tools make Vue app development easier:

- **[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) manages complex app state in an amazingly simple way**
  - This template includes... Vuex dependencies and a "Hello world" Vuex store
  - So you can immediately... dispatch actions and commit mutations
- **[Element](http://element.eleme.io/) provides useful and good-looking UI components**
  - This template includes... Element dependencies and the default Element theme files
  - So you can immediately... use Element components like `<el-date-picker>`
- **[Pug](https://pugjs.org/) makes template tags more readable**
  - This template includes... Pug dependencies
  - So you can immediately... use Pug in Vue component template tags with `<template lang="pug">`
- **[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) makes style tags more readable**
  - This template includes... Sass dependencies
  - So you can immediately... use Sass in Vue component style tags with `<style lang="sass">`
- **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) prevents a lot of versioning problems**
  - This template includes... instructions for how to use `yarn` instead of `npm install`
  - So you can immediately... lock down your project dependencies with specific version numbers

## Documentation

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/soumyabishi/gleac.git
$ cd gleac
$ yarn
$ npm run dev
```

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.

## What's Included

- `npm run dev`: first-in-class development experience.
  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint
  - Source maps

- `npm run build`: Production ready build.
  - JavaScript minified with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).
  - HTML minified with [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).
  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).
  - Static assets compiled with version hashes for efficient long-term caching, and an auto-generated production `index.html` with proper URLs to these generated assets.
  - Use `npm run build --report`to build with bundle size analytics.

- `npm run unit`: Unit tests run in [JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), or in PhantomJS with Karma + Mocha + karma-webpack.
  - Supports ES2015+ in test files.
  - Easy mocking.

- `npm run e2e`: End-to-end tests with [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/).

    - Automatically spawns the Selenium server.
